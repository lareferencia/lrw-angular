# Installation 

You can install the **'lrw-repository-widget'** component within your preferred Angular module by navigating to the 'components' folder inside the module and placing the 'lrw-repository-widget' folder there.

Within that folder, you will find three files: a *.ts*, an *.html*, and a *.css* file.

## Declaration of the component

To declare the component in your module, go to the .module.ts file and expose the 'LrwRepositoryWidgetComponent' component.
